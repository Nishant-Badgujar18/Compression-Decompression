# Compression-Decompression

Compression of files using Huffman and LZW algorithms in c programming language.

# Installation:

1. Clone Respository

    ```makefile
    $ git clone https://github.com/Nishant-Badgujar18/Compression-Decompression.git
    ```

# Run:

-   To Run makefile

    ```makefile
    $ make
    ```
-   To Run executable program file

    ```makefile
    $ ./program -(c1/c2/uc1/uc2) inputfile outputfile
    ```

(c1 - Huffman compression c2 - LZW compression uc1 - Huffman decompress uc2 - LZW decompression.)

* For compression input file must be in utf-8

* For decompression input file must be binary
